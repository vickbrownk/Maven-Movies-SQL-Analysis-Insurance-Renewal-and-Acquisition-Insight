# **Insurance Policy Renewal Project**

## **Project Objectives**
This phase of the project focuses on providing updated and accurate data essential for the insurance policy renewal process. Ensuring data accuracy is critical for seamless policy approvals.

## **Approach**
A structured data analysis approach was employed, utilizing SQL to extract and analyze key insights from multiple tables within the movies database. The project highlights problem-solving capabilities in overcoming data extraction challenges and emphasizes the importance of precision in data handling.

## **Underwriter's Letter**
This repository includes an underwriter’s letter, which provides essential context for the data analysis conducted. The letter serves as a key reference in understanding the significance of the project’s findings.

## **Key Tasks & SQL Queries**

### **1. Unique Film Titles and Categories Per Store**
This query determines the number of unique film titles and categories available at each store.
```sql
SELECT store_id, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT film_id) AS unique_film_titles, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT category) AS unique_film_categories
FROM inventory
GROUP BY store_id;
```

### **2. Replacement Cost Analysis**
Analyzing the cost range of film replacements, including the least expensive, most expensive, and average costs.
```sql
SELECT MIN(replacement_cost) AS least_expensive, 
       MAX(replacement_cost) AS most_expensive, 
       AVG(replacement_cost) AS average_cost
FROM film;
```

### **3. Payment Processing Fraud Risk Assessment**
Evaluating payment transactions to identify potential fraud risks by analyzing average and maximum payment amounts.
```sql
SELECT AVG(amount) AS average_payment, 
       MAX(amount) AS max_payment
FROM payment;
```

### **4. Customer Rental Statistics**
Determining the number of rentals per customer and ranking them in descending order.
```sql
SELECT customer_id, 
       COUNT(*) AS rental_count
FROM rental
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY rental_count DESC;
```

This project demonstrates the effective use of SQL for extracting meaningful insights, ensuring data accuracy, and supporting critical decision-making in the insurance policy renewal process.
