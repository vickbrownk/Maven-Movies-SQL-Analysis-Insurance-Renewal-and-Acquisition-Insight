**Project Overview: Maven Movies Data Analysis**

As a freelance data analyst, I undertook a compelling project for Maven Movies, a brick-and-mortar DVD rental business recently acquired by myself and my Uncle Jimmy. The primary goal of this endeavor was to harness my SQL skills to delve into the intricacies of Maven Movies' database, understand its structure, and extract valuable insights to address critical business needs.

As the new owners, we recognized the importance of leveraging data analysis to make informed decisions, optimize business operations, and respond to specific requests from stakeholders.

**Role as a Data Analyst:**
In this project, my role extended beyond a conventional data analyst. I served as a crucial member of the data team, responsible for navigating Maven Movies' extensive database and extracting pertinent information to meet distinct business requirements. This multifaceted role required a comprehensive understanding of SQL, data extraction, and analytical skills to provide actionable insights.

**Objectives of the Project:**
The Maven Movies data analysis project comprised two distinct phases, each with its unique set of objectives:

1. **Insurance Policy Renewal:**

2. **Potential Acquisition by Local Business Owner:**
   - Objective: Leverage multi-table SQL skills to answer queries from a local business owner interested in acquiring Maven Movies.
   - Approach: Conduct in-depth data analysis, extracting insights from multiple tables in the database to address the potential acquirer's questions.
   - Significance: Support the decision-making process for a potential business acquisition by providing relevant and insightful data.

This project not only showcased my technical proficiency but also demonstrated the strategic application of data analytics in addressing real-world business challenges. The subsequent sections delve into the specific details and outcomes of each project phase, highlighting the value added through meticulous data analysis.
